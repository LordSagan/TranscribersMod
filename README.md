# Transcriber's Mod
## So, what is this thing?
  This project is designed to enchance the multiplayer experience of Minecraft server, by adding new items, blocks and game mechanics. And of course, removing some.
  
## What do you think adding:
  ### Game Mechanics
    1- Economics
      * This will add a new currency, Transcriber's Livre, for short, T-Livre. People will be able to exchange for
         goods and services, in game market or player-to-player deal.
      * The game will allow you to build a company, which by completing its contracts, returning to you with payment.
         There will be two contract types: One where admin chooses and player-to-player contract
      * With T-livres, you will be able to buy items you need from game market, like for example, buying planks
         and glass to make some homes.
      * And the main story of this economy gig is, you will be able to make homes to earn money! Just add
         "Home Bed" (Different than default bed) to a house you build and it will generate you rent. You can make
           dream cities, with a great income. The imagining is up to you.
    
    2- Factions
      * You will be able to rule a country. Name them, set alliances or go blood tyrant!
      * A real-time map will show you and other factions, with enhanced border system, so you will know your
         countries border.
      * Set your flag and wave it with proud!
      
    3- Fighting
      * New factions, new peace and new war. This will allow you to build new weapons and and even new war machines!
      * Arm your AI for fighting! Onwards to battle!
    
    4- Building
      * So, you like building! or you don't. Doesn't matter, the building system will be easier and automatic!
      * Don't like building? Go and grab pre-builded homes, choose one and sprinkle around.
      * Like building? Try build testing area, where you can create masterpieces, copy and paste it to your city
         or sell the blueprint of it!
      * You can also use auto-fill commands, so it will take a few clicks to finish your roads and buidlings.
  
  ### Items
    1- Valuable Items
      * So, you will need to make money somehow. Craft this items and sell it for great prices in game market. It
         won't be easy though!
    
    2- Plants
      * New trees, flowers and crops to decorate your city!
      
    3- Tools

      * Pretty blocks for pretty cities
      * Passive buff blocks, like asphalt block that makes you go faster.
      * And interactive banner, so you can design decals for your glorious empire!
      
    2- Automaters
      * So, you don't want to struggle the whole gameplay with money-making, well you could do if you want, but you
        can use automaters to make valuable items for you. It is less slower than making with your hands though.
        
      
Well, that's not all of it! I will update and remove the mod plan time to time.

  Not for now, we will mess around until summer. It will need time to program and design all things, so every help counts!
